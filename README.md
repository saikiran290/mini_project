📧 Spam Mail Classifier and Summarizer
📝 Project Description

The Spam Mail Classifier and Summarizer is a machine learning–based application that automatically classifies emails as Spam or Ham (legitimate) and generates intelligent summaries for non-spam emails.

The project uses a Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection due to its efficiency and strong performance in text classification tasks. For summarization, it integrates the Hugging Face Transformers API, leveraging powerful pre-trained transformer models to produce accurate and context-aware summaries.

This system helps reduce email overload by filtering unwanted messages and allowing users to quickly understand important emails without reading lengthy content.
